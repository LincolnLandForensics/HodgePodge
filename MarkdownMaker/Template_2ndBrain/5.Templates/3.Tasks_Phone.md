## Sample verbiage

According to the Cellebrite Preliminary Device Report (_Preliminary_Device_Report_{date}.pdf_), the “Find My” account is registered under the name _{FullName}_, with the associated Apple ID listed as _{email}_.

A variety of Cellebrite logs were exported:  
	Accounts_{caseName}_Ex_{ex}.xlsx 
	Calls_{caseNumber}_{caseName}_Ex_{ex}.xlsx 
	Chats_{caseNumber}_{caseName}_Ex_{ex}.xlsx 
	Contacts_{caseNumber}_{caseName}_Ex_{ex}.xlsx 
	Emails_{caseNumber}_{caseName}_Ex_{ex}.xlsx 
	Financial_Transfers_{caseNumber}_{caseName}_Ex_{ex}.xlsx 
	Journeys_{caseNumber}_{caseName}_Ex_{ex}.xlsx 
	Locations_{caseNumber}_{caseName}_Ex_{ex}.xlsx 
	Notes_{caseNumber}_{caseName}_Ex_{ex}.xlsx 
	Passwords_{caseNumber}_{caseName}_Ex_{ex}.xlsx 
	SearchedItems_{caseNumber}_{caseName}_Ex_{ex}.xlsx 
	Voicemails_{caseNumber}_{caseName}_Ex_{ex}.xlsx 
	WebHistory_{caseNumber}_{caseName}_Ex_{ex}.xlsx 

The image was triaged using ILEAPP 2.3.0. Relevant artifacts and parsed data were extracted and compiled into a spreadsheet titled _ILEAPP_Ex_{ex}.xlsx for evidentiary review.

The image was triaged using ALEAPP 3.4.0. Relevant artifacts and parsed data were extracted and compiled into a spreadsheet titled ALEAPP_Ex_{ex}.xlsx for evidentiary review.

A consolidated intelligence spreadsheet containing call logs, contacts, account details, notes, search history, GPS coordinates, chat records, and web activity was saved as _Intel_{caseNumber}_{caseName}_.xlsx_ for investigative reference.

A total of {#} call logs were identified for the device {phone}. The associated WhatsApp Push Name is listed as {FullName}.

GPS data was exported as _Locations_{caseNumber}_{caseName}_Ex_{ex}.xlsx_.  
_(Examiner’s Note: The coordinates were geocoded by {ForensicExaminer} into physical addresses and, where available, associated business names. This enriched dataset was saved as _locations2addresses_{caseNumber}_{caseName}_{ex}.xlsx_. To support geospatial visualization, a KML file titled _gps{caseNumber}_{caseName}.kml_ was generated for use in [Google Earth](https://earth.google.com/). A filtered version, _gps_Illinois.kml_, was also created by {ForensicExaminer} to isolate locations within the state of Illinois. End Note.)_

The GPS coordinates {Coordinates} ({FullAddress}) were identified by CASTViz as a hotspot, indicating a high density of GPS activity. Figure {#} illustrates this location as a concentrated cluster of detections, consistent with sustained device presence or usage in the area.  
_(Examiner’s Note: According to Family Tree Now [{URL}], {FullName} is listed as a resident at this address. See Figure {#}.)_

The Cellebrite Reader report was exported under the filename  Report_{caseNumber}_Ex_{ex}.ufdr. A malware scan was conducted using Cellebrite, and the results were incorporated into the UFDR report. No malware was detected.

A set of tagged photographs was saved under the filename _Photos_Ex_{ex}.pdf. The file contains visual documentation including bulk quantities of cigarettes loaded in vans, annotated map screenshots, handwritten notes, calculator display captures, and various other cigarette-related images.

Chats were exported as Chats_Ex_{ex}.pdf.
