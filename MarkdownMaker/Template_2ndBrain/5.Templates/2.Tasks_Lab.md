## **Evidence Processing:**

- [ ] setup case folders (e:\setup_case_folder.cmd)  #  EVERYTHING in E:\Cases\ folder gets backed up nightly to B:\

- [ ] Sanitize items as needed (stickers stick better without grease)

- [ ] Input item details into [S:\Cases\ForensicCases.xlsx](file://S:/Cases/ForensicCases.xlsx)

- [ ] Print stickers x 4 (python ForensicsReporter.py -s)

- [ ] Create Todo.md (python ForensicsReporter.py -r) (move it into obsidian 8.Tasks)

- [ ] Tape stickers on all removable items (HDD, PC, Side Panel, Power supply, etc)

- [ ] Shelve and update StorageLocation in sheet (ex. 4th Floor Lab A6)

- [ ] CaseNotes setup (python MarkdownMaker.py -b -t -T Template_Cases -O E:\Cases\{caseNumber}_{caseName}\Notes_{caseNumber}_{caseName})

- [ ] Photos

- [ ] Write a summary of the warrant in the first item number Summary column. (On {dateSeized}, {forensicExaminer} attended the warrant at the {seizureAddress}.)

- [ ] Copy all case item lines into Printing_Temp sheet in [S:\Cases\ForensicCases.xlsx](file://S:/Cases/ForensicCases.xlsx), print and tape onto the top of the shelf. Draw arrows for multi-shelf cases.


## Standards


- [ ] **ISO 8601** Time format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS

- [ ] use **ALL CAPS** for last names for clarity and uniformity (matches FBI, NCIC & DOJ standards)

- [ ] DFE (Digital Forensics Examiner) {LASTNAME} (to protect the full identity of the examiner)

- [ ] (To convert timestamps to UTC or CST, that is the question?)
