## **Evidence Processing Linux:**



* \[ ] Image HDD (name the image {caseNumber}*Ex*{Ex}.e01) Save in (case....\\Ex\_{Ex}\\Image)
* \[ ] Make a working copy in  (CaseWF{caseNumber}\\Ex\_{Ex}\\imageCOPY)
* \[ ] Import imaging log into ForensicCases.xlsx (python ForensicsReporter.py -l )
* \[ ] Analyze with FTK
* \[ ] Verify image hash (FTK imager or FTK) (tools/verify image integrity)

* \[ ] review ~/.bash\_history
* \[ ] /etc/shadow
* \[ ] Crack hashes (John or passware) )(optional)
* \[ ] Browser passwords to passwords.xlsx
* \[ ] Web history logs were exported as WebHistory\_{caseNumber}*{caseName}*{ex}.xlsx.
* \[ ] Export digital evidence
