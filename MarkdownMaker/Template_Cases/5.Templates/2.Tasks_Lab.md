## **Evidence Processing:**



* \[ ] Setup case folders (e:\\setup\_case\_folder.cmd)  #  EVERYTHING in E:\\Cases\\ folder gets backed up nightly to B:\\
* \[ ] Sanitize exhibits as needed (stickers stick better without grease)
* \[ ] Input exhibit details into [S:\\Cases\\ForensicCases.xlsx](file://S:/Cases/ForensicCases.xlsx)
* \[ ] Print stickers x 4 (python ForensicsReporter.py -s)
* \[ ] Tape stickers on all removable items (HDD, PC, Side Panel, Power supply, etc)
* \[ ] Test / document write blocker is working
* \[ ] Create Todo.md (python ForensicsReporter.py -r) (move it into obsidian 8.Tasks)
* \[ ] Shelve and update StorageLocation in sheet (ex. 4th Floor Vault U1)
* \[ ] CaseNotes setup (python MarkdownMaker.py -b -t -T Template\_Cases -O E:\\Cases{caseNumber}*{caseName}\\Notes*{caseNumber}\_{caseName})
* \[ ] Photos (Save in DigitalEvidence folder)
* \[ ] Review the signed warrant. Verify you can analyze.
* \[ ] Write a summary of the warrant in the first exhibit number Summary column. (On {dateSeized}, {forensicExaminer} attended the warrant at the {seizureAddress}.)
* \[ ] Copy all case exhibits lines into Printing\_Temp sheet in [S:\\Cases\\ForensicCases.xlsx](file://S:/Cases/ForensicCases.xlsx), print and tape onto the top of the shelf. Draw arrows for multi-shelf cases.



## Standards:



* \[ ] **ISO 8601** Time format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
* \[ ] Use **ALL CAPS** for last names for clarity and uniformity (matches FBI, NCIC \& DOJ standards)
* \[ ] DFE (Digital Forensics Examiner) {LASTNAME} (to protect the full identity of the examiner)
* \[ ] (To convert timestamps to UTC or CST, that is the question?)
