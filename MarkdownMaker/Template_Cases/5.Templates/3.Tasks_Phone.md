## Sample verbiage

According to the Cellebrite Preliminary Device Report (_Preliminary_Device_Report_{date}.pdf_), the “Find My” account is registered under the name _{FullName}_, with the associated Apple ID listed as _{email}_.

A variety of Cellebrite logs were exported:  
	Accounts_{caseName}_Ex_{ex}.xlsx 
	Calls_{caseNumber}_{caseName}_Ex_{ex}.xlsx 
	Chats_{caseNumber}_{caseName}_Ex_{ex}.xlsx 
	Contacts_{caseNumber}_{caseName}_Ex_{ex}.xlsx 
	Emails_{caseNumber}_{caseName}_Ex_{ex}.xlsx 
	Financial_Transfers_{caseNumber}_{caseName}_Ex_{ex}.xlsx 
	Journeys_{caseNumber}_{caseName}_Ex_{ex}.xlsx 
	Locations_{caseNumber}_{caseName}_Ex_{ex}.xlsx 
	Notes_{caseNumber}_{caseName}_Ex_{ex}.xlsx 
	Passwords_{caseNumber}_{caseName}_Ex_{ex}.xlsx 
	SearchedItems_{caseNumber}_{caseName}_Ex_{ex}.xlsx 
	Voicemails_{caseNumber}_{caseName}_Ex_{ex}.xlsx 
	WebHistory_{caseNumber}_{caseName}_Ex_{ex}.xlsx 

A consolidated intelligence spreadsheet containing call logs, contacts, account details, notes, search history, GPS coordinates, chat records, and web activity was saved as _Intel_{caseNumber}_{caseName}_.xlsx_ for investigative reference.

A total of {#} call logs were identified for the device {phone}. The associated WhatsApp Push Name is listed as {FullName}.

GPS data was exported as _Locations_{caseNumber}_{caseName}_Ex_{ex}.xlsx_.  
_(Examiner’s Note: The coordinates were geocoded by {ForensicExaminer} into physical addresses and, where available, associated business names. This enriched dataset was saved as _locations2addresses_{caseNumber}_{caseName}_{ex}.xlsx_. To support geospatial visualization, a KML file titled _gps{caseNumber}_{caseName}.kml_ was generated for use in [Google Earth](https://earth.google.com/). A filtered version, _gps_Illinois.kml_, was also created by {ForensicExaminer} to isolate locations within the state of Illinois. End Note.)_

The GPS coordinates {Coordinates} ({FullAddress}) were identified by CASTViz as a hotspot, indicating a high density of GPS activity. Figure {#} illustrates this location as a concentrated cluster of detections, consistent with sustained device presence or usage in the area.  
_(Examiner’s Note: According to Family Tree Now [{URL}], {FullName} is listed as a resident at this address. See Figure {#}.)_


A Cellebrite Reader report was exported under the filename _report_{caseNumber}_Ex_{ex}.ufdr_. Key items of evidentiary value were tagged as “Important” within the report. A malware scan was conducted on the device and its results were incorporated into the UFDR file. No malware was detected during the examination

The image was triaged using ILEAPP version 2.3.0. Relevant artifacts and parsed data were extracted and compiled into a spreadsheet titled _ILEAPP_Ex_{ex}.xlsx_ for evidentiary review.
  
A compiled set of tagged photographs was saved under the filename _Photos_Ex_{ex}.pdf_. The file contains visual documentation including bulk quantities of cigarettes loaded in vans, annotated map screenshots, handwritten notes, calculator display captures, and various other cigarette-related images.
