## Sample Verbiage:



According to the Cellebrite Preliminary Device Report (*Preliminary\_Device\_Report*{date}.pdf\_), the “Find My” account is registered under the name *{FullName}*, with the associated Apple ID listed as *{email}*.

A variety of Cellebrite logs were exported:  
Accounts\_{caseName}*Ex*{ex}.xlsx
Calls\_{caseNumber}*{caseName}Ex{ex}.xlsx
Chats*{caseNumber}*{caseName}Ex{ex}.xlsx
Contacts*{caseNumber}*{caseName}Ex{ex}.xlsx
Emails*{caseNumber}*{caseName}Ex{ex}.xlsx
Financial\_Transfers*{caseNumber}*{caseName}Ex{ex}.xlsx
Journeys*{caseNumber}*{caseName}Ex{ex}.xlsx
Locations*{caseNumber}*{caseName}Ex{ex}.xlsx
Notes*{caseNumber}*{caseName}Ex{ex}.xlsx
Passwords*{caseNumber}*{caseName}Ex{ex}.xlsx
SearchedItems*{caseNumber}*{caseName}Ex{ex}.xlsx
Voicemails*{caseNumber}*{caseName}Ex{ex}.xlsx
WebHistory*{caseNumber}\_{caseName}*Ex*{ex}.xlsx

The image was triaged using ILEAPP 2.3.0. Relevant artifacts and parsed data were extracted and compiled into a spreadsheet titled *ILEAPP\_Ex*{ex}.xlsx for evidentiary review.

The image was triaged using ALEAPP 3.4.0. Relevant artifacts and parsed data were extracted and compiled into a spreadsheet titled ALEAPP\_Ex\_{ex}.xlsx for evidentiary review.

A consolidated intelligence spreadsheet containing call logs, contacts, account details, notes, search history, GPS coordinates, chat records, and web activity was saved as *Intel*{caseNumber}*{caseName}*.xlsx\_ for investigative reference.

A total of {#} call logs were identified for the device {phone}. The associated WhatsApp Push Name is listed as {FullName}.

GPS data was exported as *Locations*{caseNumber}*{caseName}Ex{ex}.xlsx*.  
*(Examiner’s Note: The coordinates were geocoded by {ForensicExaminer} into physical addresses and, where available, associated business names. This enriched dataset was saved as locations2addresses{caseNumber}*{caseName}*{ex}.xlsx*. To support geospatial visualization, a KML file titled *gps{caseNumber}*{caseName}.kml\_ was generated for use in [Google Earth](https://earth.google.com/). A filtered version, *gps\_Illinois.kml*, was also created by {ForensicExaminer} to isolate locations within the state of Illinois. End Note.)\_

The GPS coordinates {Coordinates} ({FullAddress}) were identified by CASTViz as a hotspot, indicating a high density of GPS activity. Figure {#} illustrates this location as a concentrated cluster of detections, consistent with sustained device presence or usage in the area.  
*(Examiner’s Note: According to Family Tree Now \[{URL}], {FullName} is listed as a resident at this address. See Figure {#}.)*

The Cellebrite Reader report was exported under the filename  Report\_{caseNumber}*Ex*{ex}.ufdr. A malware scan was conducted using Cellebrite, and the results were incorporated into the UFDR report. No malware was detected.

A set of tagged photographs was saved under the filename *Photos\_Ex*{ex}.pdf. The file contains visual documentation including bulk quantities of cigarettes loaded in vans, annotated map screenshots, handwritten notes, calculator display captures, and various other cigarette-related images.

Chats were exported as Chats\_Ex\_{ex}.pdf.
