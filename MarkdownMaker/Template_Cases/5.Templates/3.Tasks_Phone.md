## Sample verbage

According to the Cellebrite Preliminary Device Report (Preliminary_Device_Report_{date}.pdf), the "Find My" "Account Name" is "{FullName}" and the Apple ID is "{email}". 

A variety of Cellebrite logs were exported:  
	Accounts_{caseName}_Ex_{ex}.xlsx 
	Calls_{caseNumber}_{caseName}_Ex_{ex}.xlsx 
	Chats_{caseNumber}_{caseName}_Ex_{ex}.xlsx 
	Contacts_{caseNumber}_{caseName}_Ex_{ex}.xlsx 
	Emails_{caseNumber}_{caseName}_Ex_{ex}.xlsx 
	Financial_Transfers_{caseNumber}_{caseName}_Ex_{ex}.xlsx 
	Journeys_{caseNumber}_{caseName}_Ex_{ex}.xlsx 
	Locations_{caseNumber}_{caseName}_Ex_{ex}.xlsx 
	Notes_{caseNumber}_{caseName}_Ex_{ex}.xlsx 
	Passwords_{caseNumber}_{caseName}_Ex_{ex}.xlsx 
	SearchedItems_{caseNumber}_{caseName}_Ex_{ex}.xlsx 
	Voicemails_{caseNumber}_{caseName}_Ex_{ex}.xlsx 
	WebHistory_{caseNumber}_{caseName}_Ex_{ex}.xlsx 

A combined Intel sheet with call logs, contacts, accounts, notes, searched items, GPS locations, chats and web history logs were saved as Intel_{caseNumber}_{caseName}_.xlsx

There were {#} call logs for {phone} (Whats app Push Name: {FullName}). 

GPS locations were exported as Locations_{caseNumber}_{caseName}_Ex_{ex}.xlsx. (EXAMINER NOTE: GPS coordinates were converted by {ForensicExaminer} to addresses, and some business names, and saved as locations2addresses_{caseNumber}_{caseName}_{ex}.xlsx. In addition gps{caseNumber}_{caseName}.kml was created to help visualize coordinates in Earth.Google.com. gps_Illinois.kml was created by {ForensicExaminer} to further limit the coordinate set to Illinois locations. END NOTE)

The GPS coordinates {Coordinates} ({FullAddress}) were 
identified by CASTViz as a hotspot, indicating a location with a high concentration of GPS activity. Figure {#} visually 
highlights this area as a cluster of significant GPS detections, suggesting prolonged device usage at that location. 
(EXAMINERS NOTE: According to Family Tree Now  
({URL}) {FullName} resides at that home. END NOTE) (See Figure {#}) 


A Cellebrite reader report was exported as report_{caseNumber}_Ex_{ex}.ufdr, with relevant items tagged as “Important”. A malware scan was performed on this phone and was included in the UFDR report.
